Nodemon Simulator
====

## Simple intro:
It is a simulator for nodemon with the help of `chokidar`, `lodash.debounce`, `caporal`, `fs` ,`child_process` and `chalk` modules. 

## Usage:
 You can use `watchit [filename]` to run a file, and if you make changes to that file, 
the program will be restarted automatically such as watchit test.js.
